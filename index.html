          <p>
            Dungeons to Fungeons, or DTF for short, is a concept I have been
            throwing around for a few years now. <br />
            Backstory? Sure. I wanted to play a simplified version of DND.
            Something that anyone could play, without past knowledge. I have
            played games the claimed to be simplified, only to have many of the
            draw-backs they claim to prevent. So I am creating the tool for
            playing a paper based dungeon game with friends. <br />
            You only need two sheets to get started. Print the Character sheet
            Front and Back. Print the Rule sheet Front and Back. <br />
            <div class="text-center">

              <a href="/Char-front.html" target="_blank" class="m-1">

            With the print-outs at hand you have everything needed to get playing. I would like to mention basic knowledge of role-playing games is implied a bit here.
            However, to ensure we are all on the same page, I have provided a key below. <br>
            Keep in mind I am giving maximum freedom to the Master to shorten the start-up time and 
            increase game-play time. It's all in the rule sheet. Have fun, share with friends, and don't forget to post pictures with <strong>#DTF</strong> and <strong>#DungeonstoFungeons.</strong>

            Print Each With Minimum Margin on standard sized paper. Print out Should fill one full page per print.
