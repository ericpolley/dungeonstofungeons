            <strong>Player:</strong> <br />
            As a player, you will fill out your character sheet and live as this
            character. <br />
            Make up your characters Name, your LV is 1, and XP is 0. <br />
            Check one box for each of the following: Age, Race, Body Build,
            Race, and Species. <br />
            The STATS for your character are included in your appearance
            decisions. Transfer the STR, DEX, and INT from next to the
            appearance details, to the STATs list STR, DEX, INT currently
            labeled -1. If a stat did not change, you may leave it at -1.
            <br />
            You gain one STAT point(either STR, DEX, or INT) per LV (level). You
            may add one point, as you are now LV.1. <br />
            With your STATs set, use stat info to fill in HP and MANA. On the
            back side of your character sheet are skills you may buy using the
            stat points you have acquired. One Stat point per skill. Skills may
            not be doubled up. You may not change once a decision has been made.

            <br />
            <br />
            A general guide is on the back of your character sheet at the bottom
            of the page. Refer to it when you need some game play advice.

            <strong>Master:</strong> <br />
            You rule the world. The player lives and dies in your world. The
            goal is to make a fun and interesting story for the game to follow.
            This is a new kind of role playing game, and to keep it simple for
            the player, a lot of imagination is required from the Fungeons
            Master. <strong> EX: </strong> If the party is fighting some
            Jelly's, on the Jelly's turn, instead of having the Jelly
            generically attack; have the player roll a 10 with 1d10+dex to see
            if the player is engulfed by a Jelly. If they are stuck, make them
            roll on there turn to get out. Give them 3 turns till they run out
            of air, or they pass out. Remember that the player has created a
            unique character with STAT points. Apply these STAT points to rolls
            as much as possible.

            <strong>EX: </strong> If a player is trying to sneak passed gaurds.
            Roll 1d10+DEX. <br />
            <strong>EX: </strong>If a player is pulling themselves up a rope,
            you maybe roll 1d10+STR, <strong> but </strong>if an orc is shaking
            the rope from the bottom. Roll 1d10+dex.

            <strong>EX: </strong> If the player tries to build something, 1d10
            +INT.
